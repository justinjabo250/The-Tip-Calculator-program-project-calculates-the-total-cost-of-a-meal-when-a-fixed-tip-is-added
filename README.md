# The-Tip-Calculator-program-project-calculates-the-total-cost-of-a-meal-when-a-fixed-tip-is-added


##### In this project I'm going to develop a software application named "Tip Calculator Program Project". The food and beverage director, which also serves as the Asanka Hotel's finance officer, has asked for a program that determines how much a meal will cost total when a set tip is applied. Therefore, I wanted to use Python and Jupyter Notebook technologies to develop a useful and constructive software program. As a result, this software will assist the business in organizing and using carefully estimated and well-calculated costs as intended, which will aid in the audit process and produce favorable results and potential decisions.


##### I've included all of the business requirements here so that we can create software that will meet the intended business needs and be viewed favorably by managers and stakeholders who will be using the data to extract insightful information and patterns from it.  



**The program should ask the user to enter the charge for the food.**

**It should then calculate the amounts of an 18 percent tip and 7 percent sales tax on the charge of the food and display each of these amounts.**

**Finally, it should add everything together and display the charge of the food plus tip and sales tax.**

**Based on this data, your program should generate script that meets the requirements.**




**An example of how the software we will be building is run is shown below.**


**Here is a visual of an input**

**Charge for food = $50.00**



**This is the result(outcome) of the program after it has been run(executed).**


**Tip = $9.00**

**Sales tax = $3.50**
**Grand total = $62.50**
